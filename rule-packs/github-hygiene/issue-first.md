# Issue-First Development

1. **STOP.** Do not write code.
2. **Clarify** the request. Ask questions if scope is ambiguous.
3. **Draft issue** with Summary, Context, Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope (see [Issue Template](../../docs/AGENTS_REFERENCE.md#issue-template)).
4. **Get explicit approval** before proceeding.

**Scope:** All file changes—code, docs, config, single-line fixes. Audit trail is non-negotiable.

Use `gh issue create`. Reference screenshots using raw GitHub URLs after committing them.
