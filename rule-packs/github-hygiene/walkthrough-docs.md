# Walkthrough Documentation

**After each substantial implementation round**, create a walkthrough document.

**Location:** `docs/walkthroughs/{issue-num}-{issue-slug}_W{N}.md`

**Required Sections:**
1. Summary (what was implemented)
2. Files Changed (table)
3. Implementation Details (technical decisions)
4. How to Verify (testing steps)
5. Known Limitations
6. Commits (links)

**When to produce:**
- After completing each implementation round
- Before marking PR ready
- When user requests via `/walkthrough`

**Retention:** On issue close, prompt user whether to keep or archive walkthroughs.

See [Walkthrough Template](../../docs/AGENTS_REFERENCE.md#walkthrough-template).
