# AGENTS.local.md — Repository-Specific Overrides

This file extends the base AGENTS.md constitution with project-specific customizations.

**Precedence:** AGENTS.local.md overrides AGENTS.md when conflicts exist.

**What Goes Here:** Project-specific details like tech stack, build commands, testing requirements, and architectural patterns. Keep the base AGENTS.md focused on universal workflow standards; put project-specific context here.

**Common Extension Areas:**
- **Tech Stack** - Framework versions, language specifics, key dependencies
- **Build/Test Commands** - How to run, test, and build the project
- **Testing Standards** - Coverage expectations, test patterns
- **Code Style** - Formatting rules, naming conventions (if not in .editorconfig)
- **Architecture** - File organization, design patterns
- **Security** - Auth flows, secrets management, data validation
- **Performance** - Optimization requirements, bundle size limits
- **Deployment** - How/where code gets deployed

## Project Overview

This is a [brief description of project].

**Tech Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for bundling
- Testing with Vitest
