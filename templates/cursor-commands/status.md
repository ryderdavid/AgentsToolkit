Show current workflow status (branch, linked issue, commits, PR state).

**Purpose:**
Verifies AGENTS.md workflow compliance by showing:
- Current branch (should be feature branch, not main/master per [Prime Directives](../../AGENTS.md#prime-directives))
- Linked issue (required per [Issue-First Development](../../AGENTS.md#issue-first-development))
- Commit status and PR state

Run: `python3 .agents/commands/status.py`
